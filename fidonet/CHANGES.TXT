List of changes for version 1.19j, released 25th March 1994:
------------------------------------------------------------

- Extended the number of QSPIL baudrates supported to allow for sixteen
  possible rates, as described in the new QSPHAYES documentation.
  The new rates supported are 7200, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600,
  24000, 26400, 28800 and 38400 bps.


List of changes for version 1.19i, released 26th March 1993:
------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed some obscure bugs in the SEAlink sender code, which could cause
  SEAlink transmit sessions to fail badly with certain mailers.

- The "product version numbers" in the .PKT header are now correctly set.

- The last block of a sent file is now padded with CTRL-Z's to avoid "junk"
  being added to the file when using XMODEM.

- Not a bugfix, but please note that my FidoNet address has changed from
  2:283/500 to 2:283/1!

   
List of changes for version 1.19h, released 25th December 1992:
---------------------------------------------------------------

- When initiating a plain XMODEM receive, a file length of 65535 was reported.
  Fixed now.

- When receiving, SEAlink Overdrive is now only requested when the inbound 
  device is a RAMdisk. This prevents flow control problems which showed up when 
  receiving using SLO.

- When the receiver switched back to Checksum mode, the SENDNAK routine still
  polled the other end with a C rather than NAK. Fixed now.

  
List of changes for version 1.19g, released 12th April 1992:
------------------------------------------------------------

- Once again made some changes to SEAlink error recovery (comments please,
  Marco!)


List of changes for version 1.19f, released 5th April 1992:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Improved SEAlink error recovery logic; hopefully it works now...


List of changes for version 1.19e, released 16th February 1992:
---------------------------------------------------------------

- When resuming an interrupted transfer using SEAlink RESYNC, the file date was
  changed after the transfer, so further RESYNCs on the same file were
  impossible (at least on V2 drivers). Fixed now.

- Minor fix: a NAK is now sent when an out-of-sync block has been received.
  Previous versions caused a timeout to occur if this happened.

- SEAlink Overdrive (i.e. "ackless" SEAlink, used on MNP-connections) didn't
  acknowledge EOF. Was already fixed in 1.19d, but I forgot to include it in
  the list...
  

List of changes for version 1.19d, released 11th January 1992:
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Introduced some delay when starting up a session. This will hopefully
  eliminate "fall-through" to the BBS which was reported on earlier versions.

- Many users of Miracle Systems harddisks reported problems, mainly caused by
  the delayed directory update when a new file is created. The SEAlink code now
  incorporates a kludge which hopefully eliminates this; I'm unable to test it
  myself since I don't have a harddisk anymore...

- The SEAlink receive buffer is now also written out if the receive session
  fails for some reason.

- The time stamp stored at offset 10 in the file header, which was removed in
  1.19b, is now back again. The actual problem was that I forgot to clear the
  other header fields before writing out the header...

  
List of changes for version 1.19c, released 27th December 1991:
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed MACFLOW problems which occurred occasionally at end of file;
- Inbound files now don't have junk appended at their end when using Telink or
  SEAlink and the inbound is on RAMdisk.


List of changes for version 1.19b, released 26th December 1991:
---------------------------------------------------------------

- MAIL used a 32K buffer in SEAlink receive when using a winchester disk for
  inbound. Unfortunately, flushing of the entire 32K buffer to disk failed
  because IO.SSTRG fails when the "length" parameter exceeds 32767! The buffer
  size when using win_ has now been reduced by 128 bytes so it will hopefully
  work OK now.

- The time stamp stored at offset 10 decimal in the file header on non-V2
  drivers caused major problems with TOSSMAIL v1.19b, which treated it as an
  offset in the packet file to resume tossing from after an interrupted toss!
  This feature has now temporarily been disabled until a new version of
  TOSSMAIL comes out.

List of changes for version 1.19a, releaased 24th December 1991:
----------------------------------------------------------------

- First new release since v1.04.
